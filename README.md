# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
Heart disease has become an increasing concern globally, affecting individuals across all age groups and genders. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Ischemic heart disease accounts for 16% of total deaths, and strokes account for 11%. Since the year 2000, deaths from these conditions have risen significantly, with more than 2 million additional deaths each year, reaching 8.9 million deaths by 2019. Common heart conditions include blood vessel-related diseases, such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and congenital heart defects, among others.

## Motivation
Early prediction of heart disease is crucial in the clinical data analysis process, as it plays a significant role in preventing and managing heart-related illnesses. However, predicting heart disease is a complex task due to a variety of contributing factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, and several other risk factors. 

The rapid growth of available healthcare data (big data) has opened new opportunities to use modern data mining techniques to extract meaningful insights from large clinical datasets. These techniques can aid in diagnosing and predicting heart disease at early stages, potentially reducing the mortality rate.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can help in diagnosing heart disease early by leveraging clinical data. Using modern machine learning and data mining approaches, the project aims to:

- Analyze and process large-scale clinical data
- Identify patterns and key risk factors contributing to heart disease
- Develop a predictive model that provides accurate and early predictions of heart disease
## Setup
### 1. **Clone the Repository**

  git clone https://github.com/pipipip169/Sentiment-Analysis.git
    
### 2. **Install required packages**

  pip install -r requirements.txt


## Results
The project aims to achieve a high accuracy in predicting heart disease using different machine learning models, including:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- AdaBoost
The final accuracy results will be presented based on the test dataset's performance.
